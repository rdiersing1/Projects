This was a project assigned to me in CSCI 104 at USC. 
Some of the source code was provided to me by my professor
which is indicated in the coments. 

This code was constructed for a Ubuntu 64bit opperating system, and make currently
uses g++ to compile the code. However I have provided a release file as well as the 
source code, so if you are on windows x64 you can simply open your command line and run
scrabble with the config file as a command lind argument. 

to run on windows open the Scrabble/release folder in your command prompt and enter
Scrabble config.txt
