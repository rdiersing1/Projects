This was a very ambitious project that I created before I even knew anything about
object oriented design or for that matter many data structures. 

This game comes with three different game modes, two of which currently work
1. Classic (all of the good old classic rules of battleship)
2. Salvo (the number of missiles you have per turn is based off of the number of ships you have left)
3. Super Weapons (this game mode currently does not work, look for it in future updates)

The rules are explained in the introduction of the game, and it is meant to
be compiled on a linux operating system with a g++ compiler.

There is only one file so to compile just enter the command: 
g++ Battleship.cpp -o Battleship

Or if you are on windows x64 just run the application in the release folder.
