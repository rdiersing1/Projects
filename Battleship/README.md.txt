This was a very ambitious project that I created before I even knew anything about
object oriented design or for that matter many data structures. 

This game comes with three diffrent game modes, two of which currently work
1. Classic (all of the good old classic rules of battleship)
2. Salvo (the number of missiles you have per turn is based off of the number of ships you have left)
3. Super Wepons (this gamemode currently does not work, look for it in future updates)

The rules are explained in the introduction of the game, and it is ment to
be compiled on a linux opperationg system with a g++ compiler.

there is only one file so to compile just enter the command: 
g++ Battleship.cpp -o Battleship
