This project was made VERY EARLY on in my coding career.
This was made before I was even aware of what classes were or what object-oriented
design was. This code is aesthetically disgusting and disastrously long.
However, I am including it in my portfolio because it shows the AMBITION
I have as a programmer.

I developed this in the Ubuntu environment
originally,I just added a release folder so that
it could be run on windows.

Give it a try, it's actually really fun!
