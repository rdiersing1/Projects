This project was made very early on in my coding carrier.
This was made before I was even aware of classes or object oriented
programming. This was created completely independently and I am including
it in this portfolio because I believe it displays my ambition as a
very new programmer. I did not even know how to link different files 
together, yet I created a working battleship game with two with an ascii display 
with two working game-modes.

Again I developed this in the Ubuntu environment
originally, however I just added a release folder so that
it could be run on windows.

Give it a try, its actually really fun!
