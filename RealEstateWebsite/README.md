This is a website I have created to get my Dad more leads for his Real Estate buisness (he is a realitor not a broker).
I am currently hosting this website at diersinggroup.com so feel free to check it out! This was developed using 
a html (jsp) front end and a java backend. I purchased a private jvm from a hosting platform (mochahost) and I am
currently running it on a tomcat server. I am also using a mySQL database to store things like the blog and testimonials. 
I have also taken advantage of media queries in order to make the website responsive and mobile friendly.
