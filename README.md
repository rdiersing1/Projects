This is a small compilation of a few cool projects I have worked on either
with a professor or independently. Each one has a README file with more
details about the project. All of the projects are written in C++. I will 
include a Windows 32bit and 64bit .exe file for most projects, however all
of them can be compiled using g++ in the Ubuntu 64bit operating system.
