This is a very lightweight java server. When you run java -jar MicroServer.jar from the command line in this directory a server will be launched from localhost:8080 rooted at the web folder. 

The server for some reason does not support images yet. 

All html must be valid html!

Commands while running the server:
clients or c: shows number of clients the server is currently serving.
time or t: shows the time the server has been up for.
stats or s: shows the memory and processor stats of the server. 
load or l: reloads the website from the hard drive without shutting down the server.
